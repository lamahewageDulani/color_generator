# color_generator
This is an android application developed using java as the programming language. 

After taking the RGB values as the input and submit, then the background of that application will be changed.
This is a simple application to learn about the android basics. 
I learnt about;
* How to use reusable Strings in android development.
* How to use reusable Colors in android developement.
